# Hooks

This folder contains custom React hooks.

## Usage

Create custom hooks for:

- Reusable state logic
- Data fetching
- Side effects
- Complex component logic extraction

## Best Practices

- Follow React hooks naming convention (start with `use`)
- Keep hooks focused and single-purpose
- Document hooks with JSDoc comments
- Consider using TypeScript generics for flexibility
