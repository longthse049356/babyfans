# Types

This folder contains shared TypeScript type definitions and interfaces.

## Usage

Define shared types that are used across multiple parts of the application.

## Examples

- API response types
- Component prop types
- Database model types
- Utility types

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive names
- Export types that are reused across the app
- Keep types close to where they're used when they're feature-specific
- Use `type` for aliases and unions, `interface` for object shapes
