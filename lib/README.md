# Lib

This folder contains utility functions and helpers.

## Current Files

- `utils.ts` - Utility functions including the `cn` helper for className merging

## Usage

Add utility functions that are:

- Pure functions when possible
- Well-tested
- Reusable across the application

## Best Practices

- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Document complex functions
- Consider splitting into multiple files as the project grows
