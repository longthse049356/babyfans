# Components

This folder contains reusable React components.

## Structure

- `ui/` - shadcn/ui components and base UI components
- Root level - Feature-specific or shared components

## Usage

Components should be:

- Reusable across the application
- Well-typed with TypeScript
- Documented with JSDoc comments when needed

## Best Practices

- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use composition over configuration
- Export components from index files when appropriate
- Colocate component-specific types when they're not shared
